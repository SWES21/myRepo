Installation Steps
******************

To install this package as a developer (i.e., team member), use Pip's editable install feature::

    $ py -3 -m pip install -3 .

To install this package as an end-user (i.e., TA/grader), leverage ``setup.py`` installer::

    $ py -3 setup.py install

Note,  ``py -3`` might not work on some unix systems. In this case, try ``python3``.
